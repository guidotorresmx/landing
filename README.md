# My Website

This is the repository for my personal website. The website is built using the following technologies:

- Pug
- BulmaJS
- SCSS
- Parcel
- ES6

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guidotorresmx/landing.git
```

Then, you can install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the website locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the website by navigating to http://localhost:1234 in your web browser.

## Building for Production

To build the website for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a dist folder with the compiled website files, ready to be deployed to a web server.
